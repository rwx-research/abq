Our deployments of ABQ expect a constant authorization token from workers and
`abq test` clients connecting to it.

In the future, authorization tokens likely won't be constant, and definitely not
checked into version control, but for ease of iteration the current constant one
is checked in at `bin/abq_server_token`. The secrets used in GitHub Actions and
similar interfaces should be kept up-to-date with this token.
